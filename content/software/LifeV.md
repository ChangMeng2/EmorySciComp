[LifeV](http://www.lifev.org/) (to be read Life Five) is an open source library for the numerical solution of partial differential equations with the Finite Element Method (FEM). The choice of the FEM is motivated by its rigorous mathematical background, with a sound control of the accuracy, coupled with excellent flexibility in managing complex geometries. There are also LifeV modules for [VTK](www.vmtk.org) and [CGAL](www.cgal.org).

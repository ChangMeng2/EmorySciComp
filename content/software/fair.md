[FAIR](https://github.com/JuliaInv/jInv.jl) is written in Matlab and provides implementations of most state-of-the-art image registration algorithms. Although it is primarily designed as an academic and teaching tool, it offers great potential for developing prototypes and solving real-life problems.

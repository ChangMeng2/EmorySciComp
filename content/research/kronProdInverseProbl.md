The aim of this project is to develop efficient singular value
decomposition (SVD) approximation methods for
large-scale matrices that arise in discrete ill-posed inverse problems.
The approach will exploit inherent Kronecker
product and tensor structures, and will be the basis for a
computational platform for the efficient solution of large-scale
ill-posed problems.  Efficient approaches to solve Kronecker product
and tensor structured SVD updating problems will be developed.
Iterative methods that can incorporate regularization, sparse and
low-rank constraints on the solution will also be considered.  The SVD
approximations and updating methods developed in this project can be
used as tools to obtain approximate solutions of ill-posed inverse
problems, as preconditioners to accelerate iterative solvers, or as
tools to build solution methods for nonlinear problems.  By developing
a computational platform, based on SVD approximations, the work
developed in this proposal will have a broad scientific impact for
applications where it is necessary to compute solutions of large-scale
ill-posed inverse problems, including astronomy, cosmology,
geophysics, microscopy, and medical imaging.

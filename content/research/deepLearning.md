This project develops a new mathematical framework for deep learning based on the interpretation of certain deep neural networks as nonlinear time-dependent differential equations. This interpretation offers a new way to analyze the successes and failures of deep learning. Advances in deep learning will be made by adapting the wide array of tools available for related optimal control problems, including numerical optimization, partial and ordinary differential equations, inverse problems theory, and parallel processing, to the deep learning problem. Using these currently untapped resources provides rigorous new ways to design and train very deep neural networks that generalize well.

This project develops efficient numerical methods for solving big data parameter estimation problems that involve partial differential equations (PDEs). Parameter estimation problems of this kind impose key challenges in many scientific disciplines, e.g., in medical imaging, geophysical imaging, and deep learning. The inverse problem can be formulated as an optimization problem with constraints that are given by the PDEs. The unknowns are parameters of the PDEs (e.g., physical properties of the object to be measured). The objective is to minimize the misfit between PDE simulations and measured data plus some regularization term. 

The project aims at deriving efficient algorithms and massively parallel solvers for solving big data PDE parameter estimation problems. Its main thrusts are

- Reduced-order modeling techniques
- Stochastic optimization methods
- Parallel and distributed optimization problems

We develop new mathematical approaches, algorithms and systems for identifying pathogen strains using whole genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST) data in mixed samples. Strain identification is an underdetermined inverse problem when the samples are not cultured, i.e., contain multiple strains at unknown proportions. Therefore, we encode prior knowledge on both the strains and their proportion in a Bayesian framework. Our approaches use mixed-integer optimization to identify the most likely strains and Monte-Carlo sampling to quantify the uncertainty associated with those estimates. Motivating applications of our algorithms include the identification of *P. falciparum* (malaria) and *E.coli* (foodborne illness) strains to improve visibility and monitoring for public health officials.

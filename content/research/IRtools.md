The aim of this project is to develop a new MATLAB software package that
consists of state-of-the-art iterative methods to solve large scale
ill-posed inverse problems.  The package allows users to easily
experiment with different iterative methods (including several new
approaches) and regularization strategies with very little programming
effort. The package also includes several test problems and examples to
illustrate how the iterative methods can be used on a variety of
large-scale inverse problems.
